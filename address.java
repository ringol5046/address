/*Implement a class Address . An address has 
 -a house number
 -a street
 -an optional apartment number
 -a city
 -a state
 -a postal code. 
 Supply two constructors: one with an apartment number and one without. Supply a print method that 
 prints the address with the street on one line and the city,state, and zip code on the next line. 
 Supply a method public boolean comesBefore(Address other) that tests whether this address comes 
 before another when the addresses are compared by postal code.*/
